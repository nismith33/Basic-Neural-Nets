# Basic-Neural-Nets
Using neural networks for various easy tasks to practice PyTorch.

During my undergrad I took a course in machine learning. While we covered many of the important mechanisms that make neural nets function, the actual practical programming instruction was abysmal. So, I will be strengthening this deficiency by programming a bunch of neural networks. In particular, I would like to do:

- Some basic image classification as a warmup (CIFAR10 and CIFAR100).
- Face Matching (LFW).
- Image captioning (MS Coco Captions). I, at the time of writing, have never made an RNN, so this is a good learning opportunity

The datasets will be dealt with individually in separate notebooks, each of which will contain introductions to the data to be used and problem to be solved.
